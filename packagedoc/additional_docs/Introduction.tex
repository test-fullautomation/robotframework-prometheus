The interface library \pkg\ provides \textbf{Robot Framework} keywords to communicate with the monitoring system \textbf{Prometheus}.
With the help of this interface it is possible to use \textbf{Prometheus} to monitor data provided by \textbf{Robot Framework} tests.

Currently this library is under development. We work on it. But what is available up to now, is not ready for being used in productive systems
(but hopefully will be in near future).

Informations about how to install the \pkg\ can be found in the
\href{https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-prometheus/blob/develop/README.rst}{README}.
