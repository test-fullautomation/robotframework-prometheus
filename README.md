# Package Description

The interface library **prometheus_interface** provides Robot Framework
keywords to communicate with the monitoring system **Prometheus**.

Currently this library is under development. We work on it. But what is
available up to now, is not ready for being used in productive systems
(but hopefully will be in near future).

## Package Documentation

A (growing) detailed documentation of the **prometheus_interface** can
be found here:
